## Pipeline Overview

This guide documents best practices for RNA-seq analysis based on my 7+ years of experience optimizing bioinformatics workflows. While the specific implementation code from my professional work remains proprietary, this repository provides:

- Recommended tool configurations
- Parameter optimization strategies
- Quality control checkpoints
- Performance benchmarking insights
- Visualization approaches for biological interpretation

## Quality Control Standards

RNA-seq data quality assessment is critical for reliable downstream analysis. Key metrics include:

- Read quality distribution (PHRED scores >30)
- GC content normality
- Adapter content detection
- Duplicate rate assessment
- rRNA contamination screening

### Recommended Tools
- FastQC for initial quality assessment
- MultiQC for aggregated reporting
- Trimmomatic/fastp for quality filtering

[See detailed QC workflow](docs/quality_control.md)

## Read Alignment Optimization

Alignment strategy significantly impacts downstream analysis. This section covers:

- STAR vs. HISAT2 parameter optimization
- Handling splice junctions effectively
- Alignment rate benchmarking
- Performance tuning for various tissue/cell types

[See alignment optimization guide](docs/alignment_optimization.md)

## Expression Quantification

Modern RNA-seq analysis leverages transcript-level quantification:

- Salmon/Kallisto pseudo-alignment approaches
- TPM vs. counts normalization
- Technical bias correction
- Effective length normalization

[See quantification best practices](docs/quantification.md)

## Differential Expression Analysis

Robust statistical analysis ensures reliable insights:

- DESeq2 implementation strategies
- Multiple testing correction approaches
- Dispersion estimation optimization
- Low-count gene handling
- Batch effect correction methods

[See differential expression workflow](docs/differential_expression.md)

## Downstream Analysis

Biological interpretation requires specialized approaches:

- Pathway enrichment analysis
- Gene set testing methodologies
- Visualization strategies for biological insights
- Integration with other data types

[See interpretation strategies](docs/downstream_analysis.md)

## Benchmarking Results

Performance comparison across different approaches:

- Memory usage vs. accuracy tradeoffs
- Runtime optimization strategies
- Scalability for large datasets
- Tool comparison results

[See benchmarking data](docs/benchmarking.md)
